## Overview

**Input:** Employee details (last evaluation score, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent in the company, left, average hours per project, high_satisfaction).

**Output:** Predicted satisfaction level. 

**Web App:** Accessible via a basic Streamlit interface.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains features such as employee evaluation scores, project counts, working hours, and more.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Load the dataset using pandas.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Correct column names, define features and target, and handle categorical and numerical columns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to enhance model performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize numerical and categorical features using seaborn and matplotlib.
- **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model using a pipeline with preprocessing and a Random Forest regressor.
- **Model Optimization:** Optimize the model using Grid Search CV.
- **Model Saving:** Save the best model using joblib.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run the main script for training the models and making predictions:
python Regression.py


To run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

## Modeling

The modeling process includes:

    Defining a preprocessing pipeline for numerical and categorical features.
    Using a Random Forest regressor for the prediction task.
    Optimizing the model hyperparameters using Grid Search CV.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

    Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    R-squared (RÂ²)
Need to add more

## Results

The optimized model's performance is evaluated, and the feature importance is visualized to understand the significant predictors of employee satisfaction.

## Deployment

The model is deployed using Streamlit. To access the web app, run:
streamlit run app.py
