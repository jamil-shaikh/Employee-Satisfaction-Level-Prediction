Description
# Employee Satisfaction Level Prediction
Employee Satisfaction Level Prediction
This project aims to predict employee satisfaction levels based on various features using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, data visualization, model training, and optimization.
## Overview
 **Input:** Employee details (last evaluation score, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent in the company, work accident, left, promotion in the last 5 years, department, salary). 
 
 **Output:** Predicted satisfaction level. 
 
 **Web App:** Accessible via a basic Streamlit interface.

**Features**
Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.
Data Preprocessing: Correct column names, define features and target, and handle categorical and numerical columns.
Feature Engineering: Create new features to enhance model performance.
Data Visualization: Visualize numerical and categorical features using seaborn and matplotlib.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model using a pipeline with preprocessing and a Random Forest regressor.
Model Optimization: Optimize the model using Grid Search CV.
Model Saving: Save the best model using joblib.

**Modeling**
The modeling process includes:

Defining a preprocessing pipeline for numerical and categorical features.
Using a Random Forest regressor for the prediction task.
Optimizing the model hyperparameters using Grid Search CV.

**Evaluation**

The model is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)

**Results**
The optimized model's performance is evaluated, and the feature importance is visualized to understand the significant predictors of employee satisfaction.
