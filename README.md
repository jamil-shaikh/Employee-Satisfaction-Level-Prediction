## Overview
Input: Employee details (last evaluation score, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent in the company, left, average hours per project, high_satisfaction).

Output: Predicted satisfaction level.

Web App: Accessible via a basic Streamlit interface.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains features such as employee evaluation scores, project counts, working hours, and more. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liujiaqi/hr-comma-sepcsv).

## Features
- **Data Loading:** Load the dataset using pandas.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Correct column names, define features and target, and handle categorical and numerical columns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to enhance model performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize numerical and categorical features using seaborn and matplotlib.
- **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model using a pipeline with preprocessing and a Random Forest regressor.
- **Model Optimization:** Optimize the model using Grid Search CV.
- **Model Saving:** Save the best model using joblib.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Run the main script for training the models and making predictions:
```bash
python main.py
```

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
## Modeling

The modeling process includes:
- Defining a preprocessing pipeline for numerical and categorical features.
- Using a Random Forest regressor for the prediction task.
- Optimizing the model hyperparameters using Grid Search CV.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)
- Mean Absolute Error
- Root Mean Error
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error


## Results

The optimized model's performance is evaluated:
- **MSE:** 0.030201456783105405
- **Root Mean Squared Error:** 0.17378566334167328
- **Mean Absolute Error:** 0.12811430347824132
- **R-squared:** 0.5114066931875252
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error:** 30.27027507236356

The feature importance is visualized to understand the significant predictors of employee satisfaction.

## Deployment

The model is deployed using Streamlit. To access the web app, run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
