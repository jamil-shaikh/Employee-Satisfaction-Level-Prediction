# Forecasting-Employee-Satisfaction-level-Web-App
# Employee Retention Prediction Web App

## Overview
This project aims to develop a web application using Streamlit to predict employee retention. The application uses a Random Forest model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave or stay based on various features related to their satisfaction, performance, and demographics.

## MVP Capabilities
- **Input:** Employee details (last evaluation score, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent in the company, work accident, left, promotion in the last 5 years, department, salary).
- **Output:** Predicted satisfaction level (continuous value indicating the likelihood of the employee staying).
- **Web App:** Accessible via a basic Streamlit interface.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jamil-shaikh/Forecasting-Employee-Satisfaction-level-Web-App.git
